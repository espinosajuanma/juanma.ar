## Background

I made this shortfilm all by myself in isolation. During the mandatory
quarantine in Argentina I participated in a contest which consisted of making a
shortfilm in `48 hours`. In addition it had to accomplish two required challenges:

- The voiceover had to tell a different story than the picture
- The trigger for the story had to be _«Recipe to resist»_

Since they were two different stories, I chose the alternate timelines theme,
inspired by one of my favorite movies Back to the Future II, but with a more
apocalyptic tone.
