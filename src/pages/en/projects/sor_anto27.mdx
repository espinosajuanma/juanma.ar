## Background

This short was part of a 48 hours short filming contest. All the movies of this
competition had to follow this challenges:

> - **Tirgger theme:** _"How I became a Nun"_
> - **Modifier:** _"Silent Film"_
> - **Genre:** _"Sci-Fi/Fantasy"_

We made all the filming in one afternoon and the editing (including color
granding and vfx compositing) in 12 hours. It was our first time in this kind of
contest so we wanted to think outside the box and stand out with the visual
look.
